# Loan Default Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of loan default using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical loan data and various borrower-related factors, the model predicts the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This prediction is valuable for financial institutions to assess risk and make informed lending decisions.

## Introduction
The Loan Default Risk Prediction project aims to address the critical challenge faced by financial institutions in assessing the risk associated with loan applications. Predicting whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan is a crucial aspect of risk management in lending operations. By leveraging machine learning techniques and historical loan data, this project offers a predictive model that helps financial institutions make informed decisions and minimize potential losses.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the risk of loan default for individual loan applications. By analyzing a range of borrower-related factors such as employment status, income level, loan amount, and economic indicators, the model provides a risk assessment score that aids in evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants.

## Dataset
It contains anonymized borrower information such as Applicant details, Occupation, loan amount,  employment history and loan status (default or non-default).



## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The project starts with collecting historical loan data from reliable sources such as financial institutions or publicly available datasets. The data is then preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Features relevant to loan default prediction, such as borrower demographics, loan terms and economic indicators are selected for further analysis.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving the model's predictive performance. Techniques like encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, creating new derived features, and handling imbalanced classes are applied to enhance the data representation for machine learning algorithms.

## Model Selection and Training
Multiple machine learning algorithms are explored to build the loan default risk prediction model. Commonly used algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, k nearest neighbor, Naive-Bayes, gradient boosting, and support vector machines. The models are trained using the preprocessed data and evaluated based on performance metrics to select the best-performing model.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and specificity


## Future Improvements
To enhance the model's predictive power and usefulness, future improvements may include:
- Incorporating additional data sources such as economic indicators, borrower behavior patterns, and external risk factors.
- Fine-tuning model hyperparameters and exploring ensemble methods for better performance.
- Implementing advanced techniques like explainable AI to improve model interpretability and transparency.
